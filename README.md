EASIER TO READ IN RAW/CODE


TABS:
  Set up New Class:
    - Add a new class.
    - Add sections of class and its subsections.
    - Add weight of sections and change subsection weights if needed.
    - Make sure all requirements are met, then add the class!
  Change Grades:
    - These are permanent changes to grades. (ofc you can change it again.)
    - Choose class to change.
    - (-1) Grades mean that some grades are missing, and the final grade cannot be calculated yet.
    - Choose the section to change the grade or the subsection in the section to change the grade
    - Note: When you make a change, click save changes to write this new information.
            The red indicator means that if you leave, the changes will not be saved. 
    - You can reset the grade chosen and also delete an entire class.
  Test Scenarios:
    - Any changes made here are not saved, simply are for testing what grade you will get in certain scenarios.
    - Choose class on top right.
    - Choose section and change grade or choose sub section and change grade. 
    - Any not set grades are temporarily set to 0. 
    - You can reset the test scenario; this will show the saved information for the class. 
    - You can SAVE CLASS GRADES; this will save all current "temporary" information as permanent information. 
  Settings:
    - Change the top left icon. Click on the icon you want saved.
    - Change theme, the 4 themes are the only ones that can be "remembered".
    - Click preset for a theme, and it will be saved for the next time you open it. 
    - You can make your theme, but it will not be saved. This is to keep light. 
    - Change top left name, just to be a bit more fun :P
    - OPEN ADMIN:
      - If errors appear in either window, this usually means that a file was corrupted. Click this admin page to fix.
      - All class file sections should say "found files". If not, the "allclasses.txt" is missing. Fix this. 
      - Could not open points to the file that is usually missing. 
      - "Open all class files" opens the "allclass.txt" where the names of all the classes are. 
      - "Make example file" will teach you how to correct corrupted files if you need to recover data. 
      - EASIEST DEBUG:
        - Rename all files to other names and add classes. Then close the program and move information from previous
          one using the "Example file" to make sure the new file is corrected. 

  NOTE: This is a Very easy grade keeper for those who do not want to make an excel file for each semester. Also a VERY light program.
